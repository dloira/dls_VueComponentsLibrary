# dls_VueComponents

Here, you could find an approach to face the challenge for teams who have their own custom designs and need all their websites with the same look and feel. The idea behind is to build an extensive reusable and cohesive Vue.js components library ready for using it whatever application could like.

The best course of action will be to write the components once and update them from a single npm package distributed point. The code here is based on Vue.js version 3 and [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) Foundations by Brad Frost; by the way, Atomic Design is not covered here, instead, the focus is on how to build an extensible components library with Vue.js and the way to use it in an website application.

The repository is still work in progress!!
